Dear All, Senator Mitchell asked that I share the message below regarding the conversation he had with FM Moratinos this afternoon. Thanks, Julia

From Senator Mitchell: Moratinos said he talked with with Abbas and Erakat (and will see them in Amman on Tuesday; he thinks the meeting in Brussels tomorrow will last only one day)
