If you get a chance to pull aside the Icelandic PM -- you might try to lock down this JUSCANZ issue:
Our goal is to gain agreement from Icelandic Prime Minister Sigurdardottir to support Israel's bid for membership in JUSCANZ for the United Nations' Third Committee in New York.

1.4(B) 1.4(D) B1

JUSCANZ is an informal grouping of non-EU WEOG members that caucuses during various committee sessions at the UN. Israel became a member of JUSCANZ at the Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva in December 2009, with Iceland joining the consensus at that time. In Third Committee, JUSCANZ currently includes the U.S., Iceland, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Liechtenstein, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Andorra, Switzerland and San Marino.
