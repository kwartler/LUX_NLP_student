Objective: To determine the frequency, causes, and patient impact of adverse events in robotic procedures across different surgical specialties. Methods: We analyzed the adverse events data related to robotic systems and instruments used in minimally invasive surgery, reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) MAUDE database from January 2000 to December 2013. We determined the number of events reported per procedure and per surgical specialty, the most common types of device malfunctions and their impact on patients, and the causes for catastrophic events such as major complications, patient injuries, and deaths. Results: During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the 10,624 reports), 1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were reported. The numbers of injury and death events per procedure have stayed relatively constant since 2007 (mean=83.4, 95% CI, 74.2–92.7).
