After learning about the possibilities opening up in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, the young man decided to give it a go.An e-commerce entrepreneur from Macao introduces wine sold by his company at an exhibition in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, on May 22 (YAN WEI)""Compared with Hong Kong, the mainland features a larger space with diverse industries that can broaden my horizon. That's what attracted me most,"" the 25-year-old told Beijing Review. He has been working in Shenzhen for almost two years now, at a hi-tech company focusing on machine vision in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Youth Innovation and Entrepreneur Hub (E Hub) located in Qianhai, just across a bay from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).E Hub-based businesses can enjoy a rent discount and other subsidies from both the Shenzhen government and the hub's authority, Lo explained. Four years after settling there, BMTek, where Lo works, has gone through a growth spurt. Its staff has grown from a mere seven members to more than 100. E Hub is part of a plan for advancing the reform and opening up of the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone issued by China's central authorities in early September. The plan expands the area of the Qianhai zone by eight times, from 14.92 square km to 120 square km.Similarly, a plan for the creation of a Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin was issued in the same month. Together, the two plans provide a broader, more convenient and higher-quality environment for residents of the mainland and both SARs to live, invest and work in, said Leung Chun-ying, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top political advisory body, at an online seminar on September 13.They also make it easier for enterprises in Hong Kong and Macao to explore the vast array of opportunities on the mainland and beyond, Leung added.The Qianhai plan gives full rein to Hong Kong's long-held advantages in high-end professional services, while enabling the Qianhai zone to play a greater role, Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR Carrie Lam said.Rather than getting embroiled in competition for resources, Qianhai and Hong Kong will forge a mutually beneficial relationship, Wu Sikang, Director of the Shenzhen Municipal Government's Development Research Center, said.Like Qianhai, Hengqin, too, banks on its geographical advantage to promote regional cooperation. The Hengqin Island in Zhuhai is adjacent to Macao, with the closest points between the two no more than 200 meters apart, and is also not far from Hong Kong. Hengqin covers an area of 106 square km, over three times the size of Macao. The Hengqin plan aims to help Macao cultivate a more diversified economy and leverage its advantages in industries such as health, modern finance, hi-tech, exhibitions, trade, culture and sports.""Industries and businesses that boost employment are what we want,"" said Cong Liang, Vice Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, the nation's top economic regulator.According to the plan, young professionals from Macao who start their own businesses or are employed in innovative enterprises in Hengqin will be able to enjoy supporting policies from both Macao and Guangdong. Further measures to encourage businesses in the cooperation zone to recruit young talent from the SAR are in the pipeline.With a population of more than 80 million, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, consisting of two SARs and nine Guangdong cities, covers an area of 56,000 square km, about three times that of the San Francisco Bay Area. Regional cooperation has made the daily life of residents in the Greater Bay Area more convenient. For example, a new port of entry, with a designed capacity for handling 222,000 daily passenger crossings, has greatly eased travel between Zhuhai and Macao. Guangdong will continue to improve services for Hong Kong and Macao entrepreneurs, said Lin Keqing, Executive Vice Governor of Guangdong. Also, a range of competitions and internship programs will be launched to help them familiarize with the real world of business on the mainland. SOURCE Beijing Review"

However, the advancements in deep learning compression technologies and edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) chipsets are now enabling these technologies to be integrated at the end-device level, which could mitigate security and privacy concerns while ensuring enabled services can be delivered consistently without interruption. ABI Research, a global tech market advisory firm, estimates over 2 billion end devices will be shipped with a dedicated chipset for ambient sound or natural language processing by 2026.""NLP and ambient sound processing will follow the same cloud-to-edge evolutionary path as machine vision. Through efficient hardware and model compression technologies, this technology now requires fewer resources and can be fully embedded in end devices,"" says Lian Jye Su, Principal Analyst, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at ABI Research. ""At the moment, most of the implementations focus on simple tasks, such as wake word detection, scene recognition, and voice biometrics. However, moving forward, AI-enabled devices will feature more complex audio and voice processing applications.""The popularity of Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, and various chatbots in the enterprise sector has led to the boom of the voice user interface. In June 2021, Apple announced that Siri would process certain requests and actions offline. Such implementation frees Siri from constant internet connectivity and significantly improves the iPhone user's experience. ABI Research expects Apple's competitors, especially Google, with its latest Tensor System-on-a-Chip (SoC), to follow suit and offer similar support on its Android operating systems currently supporting billions of consumer and connected devices . In the enterprise sector, edge-based ambient sound processing remains in the nascent stage, with Infineon being one of the very early supplier of this technology. Increasingly, other sensor vendors are trialing the analysis of machine sound for uptime tracking, predictive maintenance, and machinery analytics. The combination of machine sound with other information, including temperature, pressure, and torque, can accurately predict the status of machine health and longevity. Recognizing the importance of edge-based NLP and ambient sound processing, chipset vendors are actively forming partnerships to boost their capabilities. For example, Qualcomm has been working closely with prominent NLP startups, including Audio Analytics and Hugging Face. CEVA, a chipset IP vendor, announced a partnership with Fluent.ai to offer multilingual speech recognition technology in low-power audio devices. The recent collaboration between Synitiant and Renesas aims to provide a multimodal AI platform that combines deep learning-based visual and audio processing.""Aside from dedicated hardware, machine learning developers are also looking to leverage various novel machine learning techniques such as multimodal learning and federated learning. Through multimodal learning, edge AI systems can become smarter and more secure if they combine insights from multiple data sources. With federated learning, end users can personalize voice AI in end devices, as edge AI can improve based on learning from their unique local environments,"" concludes Su.These findings are from ABI Research's Deep Learning-Based Ambient Sound and Language Processing: Cloud to Edge application analysis report.

NILT creates competitive advantages with flat optics in optical applications for 3D sensing, consumer electronics, machine vision, autonomous vehicles, and VR/AR displays; all solutions made by diffractive optical elements (DOE) and metalenses/meta optical elements (MOE). NILTMore news about: NIL Technology","NIL Technology","COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Sept. 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- NIL Technology (NILT), a leader in modern optical solutions, demonstrates breakthrough performance in flat optics. A complete NIR camera module is built using a 940 nm single metalens and a NIR sensor. Both demonstrator and customer-specific metalenses are currently being prototyped, shipped, and made ready for mass production. Continue ReadingImage from a near Infrared imaging system using a single meta optical element surface (1M MOE) designed for 940 nm wavelength. The demonstrated NILT image has excellent resolution for NIR imaging, all the way to the edge, and is comparable to images captured with a multi-element refractive lens.For more than a decade, camera lenses used in smartphones and other products have not seen revolutionary changes. Lenses are still made with multiple bulky refractive lenses or lens elements stacked on top of each other. NILT is on a mission to bring revolutionary changes to smartphone cameras by significantly reducing the size and complexity of these lens systems. This first demonstration is a 940 nm near-infrared (NIR) wavelength imaging lens with a single metasurface, used for 3D sensing and face recognition in smartphones and driver-monitoring in automobiles. The single metalens, as we will introduce as 1M, Meta Optical Element (MOE), is groundbreaking in its form, performance, compactness, and efficiency. It validates the uniqueness of MOEs over traditional refractive lenses.Compactness. MOEs are flatter, thinner, and lighter than refractive lenses, having a lens simplicity not demonstrated before. Superior. MOE lenses have significantly better imaging quality with a wide field of view, low F-number, high MTF, and high relative illumination, all at a low total track length. Cost-efficiency. Assembly costs and integration complexity will be lower. Robustness. Silicon on glass-substrate makes for strong, thermally stable lenses. Design to delivery in only four weeksNILT has more than 15 years of experience in high precision nanostructuring and is applying this to realize fast prototyping and mass production of MOEs. Prototyping is secured by high-quality Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) with a significantly quicker turnaround time than Deep UV Lithography (DUV). In addition, EBL gives ultra-high resolution and has a high degree of design freedom. Mass production is done by nanoimprint lithography (NIL), with no constraints on meta-atom geometries (size, shape, and location), ensuring best performing metalenses. In addition, nanoimprint lithography makes it possible for NILT to mass produce without relying on semiconductor geometrical limitations and processing capacity. ""Production of customized 1M MOEs is based on a combination of high expertise, and proven, validated, and reliable methodology,"" says Theodor Nielsen, CEO & Founder in NIL Technology. ""NILT is an established company with more than 1,500 purchase orders of experience. In addition, we have made customized prototypes for many years.""NILT is designing, prototyping, assembling, and bringing up mass-production of metalenses. The entire process is done internally. As a result, NILT's MOEs can be made in large quantities, with design to prototyping delivery in only four weeks and further redesign and turnaround in less than two weeks. Standard lenses with NILT designs are already shipped today.

The growing adoption of robots for new applications providing high returns on investment coupled with rising use of IoT in robots for cost-effective predictive maintenance is the key factors driving the service robotics market. In addition to this, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increasing need to reduce hospital-acquired infections to regularly, which has fueled the need for adoption of robots for the purpose of disinfection and sanitation.Ask for PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=681""Hardware component of service robots is expected to have a larger share of the market compared to software component in 2021""The hardware component will dominate the service robotics market in 2021. This can be attributed to the innovative designs needed on the hardware side. Sensors and control units on both domestic and commercial type service robots remain expensive. Operating costs for drones are often high because the batteries have to be frequently replaced if the drones are flown on a frequent basis. Batteries often contribute to a major portion to the running costs of a drone, especially when used for commercial applications. Exoskeletons remain very expensive for personal use unless some coverage is provided by the insurance. Even pool cleaning robots remain expensive today for majority of urban households. Although hardware component will have the larger share of the market, it is expected to decrease over time due to economies of scale.""Market for domestic application is projected to grow at a significant CAGR during the forecast period""Over time, the application of domestic robots has expanded in areas such as pools and lawns. New use cases, such as robotic kitchens and robotic laundry, are now being explored. The domestic application includes sub-applications such as floor cleaning, lawn mowing, and pool cleaning. Although these robots were expensive when initially introduced to the market, they are becoming more affordable now due to increased adoption and economies of scale in manufacturing. Also, increasing ageing population and less willingness of the working population to perform household chores is driving the growth of the market for domestic applications. Countries such as China and Japan are expected to be the two major countries fuelling market growth for use of service robots in domestic application.Browse in-depth TOC on ""Service Robotics Market""251 – Tables 71 – Figures 376 – PagesInquiry Before Buying: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=681""Ground service robots to dominate the market in 2021""The ground service robots are expected to account for the largest market share in 2021. Ground robots are used for a wide range of applications such as surgeries, cleaning, and elderly care and communication through telepresence and assistance. Due to increase in nuclear families and world population, the demand for household robots for cleaning, education, elderly assistance, entertainment, and hobby purposes has increased. According to the World Economic Forum 2018, ""The world needs to build 2 billion new homes over the next 80 years."" Also, the increase in the aging population worldwide has increased the demand for assistive robots, particularly in countries such as China and Japan, and affordable prices are driving the market for vacuuming robots.""North America to hold the largest share of service robotics market throughout forecast period""North America is expected to account for the largest share of the service robotics market during the forecast period. The factors driving the service robotics market in the US include the high per capita income, ongoing research programs, increasing aging population, and shortage of labor due to stringent immigration laws. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US has the highest average household net adjusted disposable income per capita among its 40 member countries. Due to this, the demand for costly robots used for surgeries is also expected to surge. Also, the wages in the US are high and have been increasing over the years. According to the Federation of American Scientists, wages in the US increased from USD 38.44 to USD 52.88 (a 37.6% increase) over the 39 years between 1979 and 2018. Therefore, it is estimated that demand for service robots would increase significantly in the US, especially for domestic applications. Mexico is still a developing country, and many service robots have not penetrated Mexico due to their high cost. Mexico can offer a good opportunity for service robots owing to a strong agriculture industry and various free trade agreements signed by the country.Key players in the service robotics market include iRobot (US), SoftBank Robotics Group (Japan), Intuitive Surgical (US), DeLaval (US), Daifuku (Japan), CYBERDYNE (Japan), DJI (China), Kongsberg Maritime (Norway), Northrop Grumman (US). Apart from these, Exyn Technologies (US), XAG (China), AMP Robotics (US), UVD Robots (Denmark), Diligent (US), HARVEST CROO (US), Starship Technologies (US) are among a few emerging companies in the service robotics market.Related Reports:Industrial Robotics Market with COVID-19 Impact Analysis by Type (Articulated, Collaborative Robots), Component, Payload, Application (Handling, Processing), Industry (Automotive, Food & Beverages), and Region - Global Forecast to 2026Smart Factory Market With COVID-19 Impact by Component (Industrial Sensors, Industrial Robots, Industrial 3D Printers, Machine Vision Systems), Solution (SCADA, PAM, MES, Industrial Safety), Industry, and Region - Global Forecast to 2026About MarketsandMarkets™ MarketsandMarkets™ provides quantified B2B research on 30,000 high growth niche opportunities/threats which will impact 70% to 80% of worldwide companies' revenues.

For example, imaging in the short-wave infra-red (SWIR) spectral region, which spans from 1000 to 2000 nm, offers multiple benefits that can supplement conventional cameras.Motivation for SWIR imagingContinue ReadingTechnological and commercial readiness of emerging SWIR imaging technologies. Source: IDTechEx - “Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets” (PRNewsfoto/IDTechEx)Arguably the most compelling attribute of imaging in the SWIR region is the reduced optical scattering of longer wavelengths of light – a phenomenon that makes sunsets red since moisture droplets scatter the blue light during the light's longer path through the atmosphere. Reduced scattering means that SWIR cameras on vehicles and drones can see through fog and dust clouds, greatly improving visibility and hence safety.Another benefit of SWIR imaging is distinguishing visually similar materials, which may have similar absorption (and thus reflection) spectra in the visible region but significant differences in the SWIR region. This ability is highly valuable for applications such as quality control in industrial processes, where it enables unwanted items such as rocks and metals to be spotted in food production for example, and sorting recycling.Other benefits include thermal imaging for items with temperatures between 200 and 500 C, and the ability to see through materials that are opaque to visible light but transparent to SWIR. Silicon is a great example of this, with SWIR imaging used to check the quality of wafer attachment.The problem with InGaAsIf SWIR imaging offers all the outlined advantages, why is it not more common? The answer is that at present short-wave infra-red (SWIR, 1000-2000 nm) imaging is dominated by expensive InGaAs (Indium Gallium Arsenide) sensors that can absorb light up to around 1800 nm. These can cost upwards of $10,000 due to the expense of producing the InGaAs layer via vapor deposition, low manufacturing yields, and limited pixel density that increases material consumption for a given resolution relative to standard silicon photodetectors. Emerging SWIR image sensor technologiesThe combination of commercially desirable attributes and an expensive incumbent technology creates a clear opportunity for a disruptive, low-cost alternative. As such, multiple competing approaches for SWIR imaging are being developed. One approach is to extend the sensitivity of silicon photodetectors beyond the usual 1000 nm by increasing their thickness and structuring the surface. Since this 'extended silicon' approach can utilize existing CMOS fabrication technologies, it is likely to be a durable and relatively low-cost alternative that is highly applicable to autonomous vehicles and ADAS systems. However, since it is based on silicon this technology is best suited to detecting light towards the lower end of the SWIR spectral region.Another method, which will likely be more expensive to produce than 'extended silicon' but capable of imaging at longer wavelengths, is using a hybrid structure that comprises quantum dots mounted onto a CMOS read-out integrated circuit (ROIC). Quantum dots have highly tunable absorption spectra that can be controlled by changing their diameter and can absorb light up to 2000 nm. This makes them especially promising for industrial imaging applications and potentially hyperspectral imaging.The accompanying graphic compares the technological and commercial readiness level of the competing SWIR imaging technologies. OverviewThe prospects for the new SWIR imaging technologies outlined above are analyzed in detail in IDTechEx's report ""Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets"".

Preview RegistryABSTRACT-Global Autonomous Farm Equipment Market to Reach $115.2 Billion by 2024Evolution of autonomous farm equipment is the result of computerization of agricultural machines. Types of autonomous farm equipment include driverless tractors, agricultural drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), agricultural robots, autonomous harvesters, etc. Autonomous farm equipment ensures more profitable use of seeds, fertilizer, irrigation water and fuel consumption, among others. Key distinguishing features of autonomous farm equipment when compared traditional mechanized farm equipment and implements include use of GPS, satellite imagery and machine vision for navigation; integration of smart sensors for context and situational awareness; use of electronic hardware for automation; use of artificial intelligence (AI) for predictive reasoning and automated decisions. In other words, AI in autonomous vehicles will be capable of identify diseases in plants, recognize crop diseases, pest damage, selectively exclude weeds during harvesting and crop picking, among others. Food security concerns have pushed innovative technologies into the field of agriculture, opening up a landmine of opportunities for automation in agriculture.Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for Autonomous Farm Equipment is projected to reach US$115.2 Billion by 2024, registering a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.3% over the analysis period. The United States represents the largest regional market for Autonomous Farm Equipment, accounting for an estimated 30.5% share of the global total. The market is projected to reach US$38.7 Billion by the close of the analysis period. China is expected to spearhead growth and emerge as the fastest growing regional market with a CAGR of 16.7% over the analysis period. Declining agricultural land productivity is the starting point for increased use of automation and innovative new generation smart technologies in farming/agriculture. While arable land use per capita is declining the world over due to land diversion for non-agricultural purposes such as urbanization, roads , industry and housing, several other factors are also responsible for decline in overall agricultural land productivity. These include non-availability of high quality seeds, fertilizers and lack of proper irrigation, delayed sowing of crops, increased plant density aggravated by arable land shortage; ill-trained farm labor; wasteful irrigation methods; ill-managed water resources; lack of adoption of new technologies; lack of quality control of seeds; soil degradation caused by excessive use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers; among others. Also, relocation of water rights from agricultural lands to municipalities in urban cities and centers as a result of lopsided developmental plans in developing countries have resulted in permanent dry-up of agricultural lands. All of these factors are resulting in either stagnation or low yields of major crops.Among these factors, unscientific agricultural practices and non-application of modern technology are two of the important reasons for low farm yield. Key reasons for this include under­developed agricultural infrastructure; lack of institutional financial support such as credit facilities; lack of policies that encourage entrepreneurship among farmers; high equipment prices; lack of subsidies, tax waivers, and other incentives; and lack of capital for investments in new technologies. Use outdated implements and technologies creates a vicious cycle of low performing farm assets, higher costs, low profits and inability to reinvest in the farm, creating the perform ground for stagnation in agricultural productivity.With governments worldwide now waking up to the importance of prioritizing agriculture and with policy reforms being implemented and legislated in favor of agriculture, bottlenecks hitherto posed by lack of access to capital and low awareness and education is expected to recede in the coming years. This will open up the market for automated farm equipment and technologies given their potential to transform and revolutionize farming and its productivity. Mechanized agricultural solutions help counter the challenge of low agricultural land productivity by addressing issues such as soil compaction; partially automated single manned machines reduce need for expensive labor while doubling the productivity gains; reduced crop losses during harvest; more judicial use of pesticides and thereby soil protection; accurate analysis of water need and provision of same to prevent water logging etc. Development of lighter machines reduces soil compaction issues which go a long way in enhancing farm yields. Machines with machine vision and AI reduce indiscriminate pesticides and herbicides use by spraying on where pests and weeds are present.

Preview RegistryABSTRACT-Global Automated Guided Vehicle Market to Reach $2.5 Billion by 2024 Automated Guided Vehicles or Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are computer controlled, wheel-based and driverless vehicles used for transporting material loads or products from one place to another. The term AGV includes all transport systems that are capable of operating without an onboard operator. Automated vehicles like pallets, carts or trays are programmed to move material loads between manufacturing and warehouse facilities without human intervention. These sophisticated machines use several guidance technologies like radio waves, lasers, floor-surface mounted magnetic tape or bars, optical sensors or vision cameras for navigation. The movement of the autonomous vehicle along the floor is controlled by a combination of CAD-based software and sensor-based guidance systems. The software determines pre-defined paths and directs the autonomous vehicle to pick-up/drop-off location. The routing decisions are based on real-time feedback received on operating conditions. The precisely controlled movements of AGVs, including acceleration, deceleration, and automatic obstacle detection bumpers ensure safe movement of material loads.Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for Automated Guided Vehicle is projected to reach US$2.5 Billion by 2024, registering a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8% over the analysis period. Europe represents the largest regional market for Automated Guided Vehicle, accounting for an estimated 31.6% share of the global total. The market is projected to reach US$803.2 Million by the close of the analysis period. China is expected to spearhead growth and emerge as the fastest growing regional market with a CAGR of 9.4% over the analysis period. The strong focus shed on automation and production efficiency in the era of smart factory and industry 4.0 represents a key factor spurring investments in automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Smart manufacturing is the new revolution that will mark the next generation of production. Self-aware, self-optimized, self-configured equipment with the ability to wirelessly communicate with each other; advanced networking; real-time controls; more closer alignment of business management and plant floor activities and supply chains; additive manufacturing are few of the disruptive smart factory trends currently underway. Among these, ""automation"" lies at the heart of the smart factory concept. Almost like the beating heart, automation provides the foundation for the creation of knowledge-embedded manufacturing operations.Benefits offered by AGVs include round the clock transit of materials; traceability that ensures that the plant manager remains informed of the material movement around the facility; ability to time-stamp pick-up, transit and delivery of items which can help in route optimization and improvements; ability to integrate information generated by AGVs into enterprise resource planning (ERP) or materials resource planning (MRP) systems; among others. There is also a growing trend in the market towards the use of multi-functional AGVs which in addition to transporting materials around the plant, can also perform other tasks which can enhance efficiency on the plant floor. For instance, when equipped with tool attachments like clamping mechanisms and positioning sensors and fixture, AGVs can also be made to perform assembly line functions.AGVs are moving from wired operation to wireless operations. Traditional wired navigation involves the use of wires embedded into the plant floor. The signal emitted by the wire is then picked by a sensor integrated in AGVs which when propels the machine in the direction of the signal guiding it all along the wired floor. From guided to self-driving is a trend that need to be underlined given its ability to improve the efficiency of these vehicles by a factor of X. Laser-based perception or machine vision and navigation algorithms; innovations in a wide variety of sensors like hall-effect sensors, position sensors, and gyroscopes need to for context and environment/location awareness; on-board programmable logic controller (PLC) that controls acceleration or braking; embedded artificial intelligence that helps learn and take autonomous decisions in situations that are beyond the pre-programmed scenarios; are all enabling the development of self-driving, fully autonomous machines.

These have a diverse range of capabilities, ranging from dramatically lowering the cost of short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging to large-area thin-film flexible photodetectors. IDTechEx's new report, titled ""Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets"", comprehensively explores the market for emerging image sensor technologies. Continue ReadingSchematic outlining the difference between conventional and event-based sensing.One of the most innovative and commercially promising technologies is event-based vision, which is a bio-inspired method of acquiring visual data that promises multiple advantages including reduced data transfer/processing and greater dynamic range. Indeed, such are these merits that IDTechEx forecast the market for the event-based vision sensor chips alone rising from its primarily pre-revenue status today to $20 million per year over the next 10 years. Furthermore, much of the value is likely to be captured by the software facilitated by event-based vision hardware, leading to a much greater total market. What is event-based vision?Event-based vision, also known as dynamic vision sensing (DVS), is a method of scene acquisition that mirrors how the human retina/brain acquires information, by recording changes as they occur rather than the entire frame at specified intervals. The approach is entirely targeted at machine vision applications and is not aiming to replace cameras/conventional image sensors.In a conventional video, an entire image is recorded at a pre-assigned interval, known as the frame rate. For machine vision applications this means that lots of unnecessary data is acquired, whereas the most dynamic part of the image is often under-sampled. Event-based vision sensors resolve this issue by detecting relative intensity changes rather than capturing frames. The pixels report asynchronously, delivering a timestamp whenever the illumination intensity passes a certain threshold. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between conventional frame-based sensing and event-based sensing for a single pixel. Motivation Event-based vision offers multiple significant advantages over conventional frame-based imaging. Arguably the most significant is that by only detecting changes, subsequent data processing can be much simpler. This is because irrelevant static areas of the image have been ignored, meaning that far less data needs to be transported and processed. Furthermore, event-based vision offers a higher dynamic range, since individual pixels report a percentage change in intensity rather than making an absolute measurement of light intensity. As such, there is far less risk of saturation. The final benefit is greater temporal resolution, with time-stamped signals from each pixel.Target applicationsEvent-based vision is highly relevant to recording rapidly changing situations that require immediate data processing (since the volume of data produced is much less). Applications that require high temporal resolution or high dynamic range are especially relevant.IDTechEx, therefore, perceives the most promising applications as collision avoidance and navigation for autonomous vehicles/ADAS and unmanned ariel vehicles (drones). These markets have huge potential but will require substantial software development and data collection to fully interpret the event-based vision data. As such, IDTechEx believes that smaller markets with much more predictable input data, such as iris-tracking for AR/VR goggles and laser beam profiling, will see the earliest adoption of event-based vision. A comprehensive overviewIDTechEx's new report ""Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets"" outlines the current status and future applications for a wide range of emerging image sensor technologies. This includes the event-based vision sensors outlined here, but also emerging technologies for short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging that are likely to replace InGaAs, hybrid quantum dot or organic semiconductor on silicon sensors, thin-film photodetectors, flexible x-ray detectors, hyperspectral imaging, and more. Also included are highly granular 10-year market forecasts by revenue and volume (split by technology and application), along with multiple application case studies and technological/commercial readiness assessments.

Machine vision enabling SLAM tracking allows for precise user trackingMore news about: ABI Research","ABI Research","NEW YORK, Oct. 6, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The need for visual and spatial data for Augmented Reality (AR) often relies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabling technologies to capture, process, and contextualize that data in an actionable way. As a result, these two markets continue to overlap and create substantial opportunity. Global technology intelligence firm ABI Research expects over 200 million active users in AR applications that leverage AI in some form by 2026; this can include foundational AR technologies like machine vision and Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) tracking, as well as value add applications like image and object recognition, semantic labeling, and expert system analytics.""The combination of AI, machine learning (ML), and AR is an incredibly potent one,"" says Eric A bbruzzese, Augmented and Virtual Reality Research Director at ABI Research. ""At the core, the capabilities of augmented reality get stronger with more data available. This data comes from location data, sensor data, environmental dynamics, and integrated systems such as Internet of Things (IoT). AR can also serve as a data collection enabler for these data types. Weaving AI into these areas brings high value and often critical AR capabilities to market."" While machine vision isn't inherently required for augmented reality—in the case of assisted reality hardware and applications—it is increasingly becoming a necessity for most use cases. Machine vision enabling SLAM tracking allows for precise user tracking in space and can also capture spatial data for later use. ABI Research expects nearly 20 million shipments of AR smart glasses with local on-device AI chipsets in 2026, which accounts for 70% of total smart glasses shipments in that year. Local processing of AI is most common today, but processing location is increasingly moving to the cloud for some AI processing types. For instance, SLAM tracking can stay on-device for reliability and low latency, but semantic labeling can sit on the cloud, sacrificing latency in a non-sensitive latency scenario for that type of data. Cloud and hybrid compute scenarios allow for the best AI processing performance versus device performance and battery life, flexibility depending on application, and environment. Many companies in the AR space have been leveraging AI in numerous ways for years, and this usage is growing both in number of companies and scope of usage. At the hardware level, Qualcomm has baked in AI enhancements specifically for AR and VR—to improve tracking accuracy and performance, for instance—in their XR chipset line. NVIDIA is leveraging AI in their CloudXR product as well as Omniverse, which most recently announced automated simulation and content creation elements using AI. Enterprise players like PTC and Teamviewer use machine vision for device tracking, as well as for backend processing, analytics, predictive processes, and more. These elements sum up to a valuable enabling technology that is harmonious with the entire augmented reality value chain. ""Point to a use case, application, service, or vertical, and AI is already being leveraged and its role will evolve substantially over the next 5 to 10 years. The value adds commonly cited for augmented reality, including increased worker efficiency and safety as well as novel collaboration and remote enablement capabilities, are enhanced with AI. More accurate and predictable tracking and data gathering, automated and targeted content delivery, newly uncovered data and usage trends all contribute,"" concludes Abbruzzese.These findings are from ABI Research's AI and Analytics in Augmented Reality Implementations application analysis report.

CICC Research's Technology Group has joined together with multiple sector research teams to complete this in-depth analysis covering potential scenarios for AI-enabled carbon emission reduction. The report demonstrates the practical effects and the evolutionary trends of AI in terms of improving efficiency, saving energy, as well as reducing emissions consumption. Peng Hu, Chief Analyst of CICC's Technology Hardware Group, delivered a keynote speech to the conference, analyzing how AI can help achieve carbon neutrality, as well as the investment opportunities in the technology industry, for example, AI-enabled cities, AI-enabled vehicles, AI-enabled smart manufacturing, and AI-enabled power. Carbon neutrality, an important application for AI After the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference, the achievement of carbon neutrality has become a global goal. As of the end of 2020, 44 countries and regions around the world made commitments on carbon neutrality. China also announced that it would achieve peak carbon levels by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.CICC believes that the key to achieving carbon neutrality lies in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP, which puts pressure on areas such as energy, transportation, manufacturing and urban construction planning in the context of China's rapid economic growth. AI is expected to promote efficiency and consumption reduction in a number of different areas and help achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. Peng explains that AI can help in three ways: prediction, monitoring and optimization. AI helps carbon neutrality in four major areas In Peng's view, AI could help achieve the goal of carbon neutrality in the four fields, namely cities, smart manufacturing, vehicles and power.City planning - AI could be used to dynamically predict urban development, improve the structure of cities, and ease problems related to long-distance commuting.Smart manufacturing - AI could help cut production costs and improve the efficiency.Vehicles - AI will drive the transformation of the traditional automotive industry, improve the consumer experience in the fields of self-driving and intelligent logistics, as well as reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.Power, AI will play an important role in the digitalization of the power grid, improve overall energy supply efficiency of the power system, and achieve the effect of reducing carbon emissions. Investment opportunities in the science and technology industries against the backdrop of carbon neutrality ESG investing has become a global trend. Peng believes that the ESG investment philosophy will prompt listed companies to pay more attention to the control of carbon emissions. Over the long term, companies with higher ESG level will achieve better operation results and more sustainable returns, which creates new investment opportunities. Peng points out that AI should also be filled with ""humanistic care"", which is not only a technical term that means increase efficiency and profits, but also plays a greater role in improving the living environment, creating social welfare and enhancing human well-being.Peng suggests to focus the investment opportunities in the following 10 areas amid AI-enabled carbon neutrality: 1) smart power grids; 2) drones for civilian use; 3) mobile robots; 4) industrial internet platforms; 5) machine vision; 6) smart cities; 7) cloud computing; 8) AI chips; 9) intelligent driving; and 10) sensors. According to the CICC's forecast, the increase of the market size of these 10 areas is around RMB 2 trillion in China over the next decade (2021–2030).To read the full research report, click here: https://en.cicc.com/api/upload/uploadService/dowloadEx?fileId=24884&tenantId=123890 China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC): China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC, 03908.HK，601995.SH) is a top tier investment bank, founded in China in 1995, providing first-class financial services to corporates, institutions and individuals worldwide.

Indeed, this revolution in farming practices provides a substantial market opportunity for technologies perhaps more commonlyMore news about: IDTechEx","IDTechEx","BOSTON, July 6, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --Syntheti bolognese Continue ReadingCreating a burger with future food technologiesFrom free-range chicken to food miles on alfalfa, eating ethically is becoming more and more of a head-scratcher. Even for vegans, there are the questions of how sustainably agave was sourced, or whether environment-damaging pesticides were used to grow kale – and all that is without even considering how the food tastes.Advances in the food and agriculture industry could answer every one of these questions, plus some of the regular consumers hadn't yet thought to ask. For a slaughter-free spaghetti bolognese, a beef burger where no cows were harmed, and fresh produce growing from the walls of skyscrapers, food technology is turning science fiction into science fact one innovation at a time. Plant-based burgers are on a rollMeat alternatives are not new. Tofu and seitan have been around for over 1000 years and veggie burgers have been on supermarket shelves for decades. However, these have typically only appealed to vegans and vegetarians, a niche market perhaps prepared to compromise on how meat-like the product is for their own ethical reasons. With the advancement of new food technologies, that may no longer be a compromise that needs to be made; plant-based food is becoming increasingly convincing as meat. One example of plant-based food appealing to a more carnivorous palette is Impossible Foods, who used genetically modified yeast to make a vegetarian burger that bleeds.But could the search for sustainable, guilt-free burgers go further? Cultured meat says yes.Culture shock: meat the new burger on the blockA burger, made from 100% real beef, but no cows were harmed in its making? New technologies in cultured meat offer a potential solution for the burger-lover who feels bad about it.Cultured meat involves directly culturing the same (or very similar) animal cells that make up conventional meat. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to create meat products completely indistinguishable from conventional meat, and without the need for slaughter. Since the world's first cultured burger was produced in 2013, the industry has grown at a rapid pace, with start-ups around the globe competing to be the first company to commercialize a cultured meat product.In December 2020, the industry received a major boost when Singapore became the first region in the world to grant regulatory approval for commercial sale of a cultured meat product, a hybrid product made from plant protein and cultured chicken cells produced by Eat Just. Many in the industry are hoping this will be the first of many approvals over the next few years, helping cultured meat transition from the prototype stage to consumer products.For more information on how cultured meat is made, and promising companies in this area, see the IDTechEx report ""Cultured Meat 2021-2041: Technologies, Markets, Forecasts"".Vertical farming takes agriculture to new heightsLet's not forget the lettuce and tomatoes! A successful vertical farming future could see people buying their veggies at markets mere meters from where they were grown. Food miles could become a thing of the past.Vertical farming is a method of growing crops indoors under controlled environmental conditions, with crops grown in vertically stacked layers to save space. This could enable yields 20-30 times higher per acre than normal agriculture. By using advanced growing methods such as hydroponics and LED lighting tailored to the exact photosynthetic needs of the crops, vertical farming can achieve yields hundreds of times higher than the same space of conventional farmland. Because it doesn't need large amounts of arable land to grow crops, it's possible to do vertical farming in urban areas, closer to population centers. This both frees up arable land and reduces the distance that food must travel to reach consumers.Almost any location can be used for vertical farming, with companies operating out of old shipping containers (Freight Farms), disused warehouses (AeroFarms uses a warehouse in New Jersey for its indoor farming) and the walls of skyscrapers. The only limitations are being able to get resources in and harvested plants out.Precision agricultureIncreasing agricultural yields in a sustainable manner will be crucial in feeding the world's growing population. Precision farming is a promising emerging approach, in which individual plants (or at least regions of a field) can receive targeted treatment. Furthermore, planting and harvesting can be tailored to ground conditions in a particular area and to the status of a particular fruit or plant.Achieving this technological transition from the incumbent, broad-brush farming methodologies requires multiple new technologies, spanning robotics, imaging, machine vision and low-cost sensors. Indeed, this revolution in farming practices provides a substantial market opportunity for technologies perhaps more commonly associated with industrial automation.Hyperspectral imagingOne technology that can monitor plant health and catch diseases early, minimizing the risk of wastage and lost crops, is hyperspectral imaging. Insight into plant health can be gained through hyperspectral imaging. Rather than expressing an image as red, green, and blue (RGB) values at each pixel location, hyperspectral imaging instead records a complete spectrum at each point, creating a full 3D data set. By obtaining a complete reflection spectrum for each pixel, far more information can be gained than from a standard image, enabling supervised machine learning to quantify chemical composition more precisely and hence determine ripeness or disease.Extensive details of the wide range of competing technologies for SWIR and hyperspectral imaging, along with other emerging image sensor technologies and market forecasts for their adoption in different industries can be found in the IDTechEx report ""Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets"".Agricultural robotics and dronesOnce agriculturally relevant data has been harvested and converted via AI into actionable insights, these need to be carried out. This will require agricultural robots, which can use this data to deliver precision-targeted planting, fertilizing, weedkilling and harvesting. Imagine varying planting densities across a field in response to soil conditions or targeting specific areas of a field with pesticides.Short-wave infra-red imagingTo appropriately target fertilizer and/or weedkiller, the attributes of individual plants need to be ascertained. While this can be done via algorithmic image analysis, conventional cameras in the visible spectrum cannot necessarily identify subtle differences between leaves or fruit at different stages of ripeness. Short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1000 to 2000 nm) imaging resolves some of these challenges since surfaces that look similar under visible light can show substantial differences under SWIR light – bruised fruit is an excellent example. An additional advantage of SWIR imaging is that scattering by clouds, dust, or mist decreases as wavelength increases, thus facilitating imaging in otherwise adverse conditions.Biostimulants and biopesticidesSynthetic chemical pesticides and mineral fertilizers are growing less and less sustainable. They are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and environmental damage, with the overuse of certain pesticides leading to the growing problem of resistance. However, much of the world's food supply still depends on them.Agricultural biologicals – crop inputs derived from nature – could form part of the solutions. Biostimulants could boost crop yields while reducing the need for fertilizers and boosting soil health and biodiversity, while biopesticides could provide much-needed new modes of action, without causing environmental damage.One other solution to the pesticide problem would be to genetically engineer plants to withstand certain common pests and diseases.Genetic engineeringAlthough many aspects of agricultural biotechnology remain controversial, the technology has enormous potential as a way of improving food security.Crop biotechnology is a set of tools and disciplines that modify organisms for a particular purpose, e.g. increasing yields, or developing an innate resistance to certain diseases in order to reduce crop losses and pesticide requirements.The basis of agricultural biotechnology is genetics, with scientists using an understanding of DNA to develop methods to improve agriculture. The ability to identify genes that can confer advantages to certain crops and the ability to work precisely with these genes can significantly enhance breeders' abilities to improve crops and livestock.IDTechEx, a leading market intelligence provider, offers a wide range of technical market research on the food and agricultural technology industry.

In the aerospace and defense industry, modular instruments are used for machine vision systems, automatic test equipment, spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, and signal generators, among others. Thus, these instruments are usedMore news about: Research and Markets","Research and Markets","DUBLIN, July 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The ""Modular Instruments Market - Forecasts from 2021 to 2026"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The global modular instruments market is evaluated at US$1.637 billion for the year 2019 and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 9.31% to reach a market size of US$3.052 billion by the year 2026.Modular instruments are the types of electronic devices that use a frame wherein different types of or a varying number of functional cards can be plugged. This is so that the instrument can accommodate a range of input/output channels or tailor its measurement capability according to the specific application being addressed. It generally uses a computer user interface instead of displays and controls embedded in an instrument, hence, known as faceless instruments. Moreover, it is provided with programmatic software interfaces known as drivers. This equipment is used to develop, design, maintain, verify, and repair various electronic and mechanical products. As modular instruments are compact, flexible, fast, cost-effective, and available in various sizes, they are utilized in photonics production, submicron and nano-precision technology, and mechanical and electrical engineering.The market for modular instruments is anticipated to be driven by the increase in awareness about the devices amongst the end-users. For instance, high channel count; these measurements, such as data acquisition, really benefit from the standards-based modular form factor. Module size is relatively big, so a large number of channels can be included. Data acquisition usually requires many types of channels. Not everything can be purchased from one vendor. The mix and match capability of modular instruments allow the system to be easily configured from multiple vendors.Secondly, automated test systems; these instruments address the needs of automated test systems very well. Automated test systems typically involve many types of instruments. The instruments are driven by software, not directly manipulated by a user. Packaging density is a concern, and the logistics of racking and cabling are as important to system design as making measurements. With modular instruments, modules can be acquired from multiple vendors. Additionally, the space factor; for a given volume and multiple instruments, modular instruments usually create the smallest, most compact solution. These factors have encouraged the adoption of modular instruments over the years and with the rapid pace of technological developments, it is expected to do so in the coming years as well.The demand is prominently influenced by the growth of the test and measurement instruments market. Modular instruments are equipment that is used to test, monitor, and are user-defined measurement systems.The advent of COVID-19 had an adverse impact on the global modular instruments market. The immense downturn in the global semiconductor industry has been a significant reason for the decline in the demand for modular instruments at a global level. The pandemic substantially affected the businesses worldwide wherein the lockdowns were imposed in several countries which further disrupted the supply chain. This made it even more difficult to attain the raw materials to manufacture the instrument during the initial period. On the supply side, the pandemic has exposed risks that were previously unrecognized, leading to potential shortages of critical parts and components. In response, many semiconductor companies are already reconfiguring their supply chains to improve resiliency, and the changes may continue into the next normal. The covid-19 crisis has given rise to a new normal wherein the adoption of emerging technologies has picked up the pace to facilitate the employees. Remote manufacturing, diagnostics, and maintenance could all become permanent features. The companies are expected to start, a hybrid model in which a certain number of employees are remote and the rest remain on site. The efficiencies gained through such changes, as well as their start-up costs, could influence future semiconductor revenues, which in turn will fuel the growth of the market in the coming years.The segmentation of the global modular instruments market has been done into type, industry vertical, and geography. By type, the classification of the market has been done into VME, AXIE, PXI, VXI. By industry vertical, the classification of the market has been done into Aerospace And Defense, Automotive, Electrical And Electronics, Telecommunication. Furthermore, based on geography, the global market has been distributed as North America, South America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and the Asia Pacific.Rising demands coming from the defense sector at a global level will drive the market during the forecast period.The growth of the modular instruments market is fuelled by the increasing demands coming from the defense sector of various countries across the world. demands for modular and flexible instruments in the aerospace and defense sector in developed economies are expected to be one of the key factors driving the growth of the modular instruments market. For instance, the United States Department of Defense's base budget for FY 2021 is USD 633 billion, which is by far the largest defense budget. It may eventually boost modular testing equipment sales, as it plays a significant role in monitoring the performance of command and communication networks and surveillance applications. Modular instruments play a vital role in the aerospace and defense sector owing to complex communication equipment. In the aerospace and defense industry, modular instruments are used for machine vision systems, automatic test equipment, spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, and signal generators, among others. Thus, these instruments are used for ensuring the security and safety of the end-use equipment by checking various sub-systems, components, and systems for communications, tracking, and detection. Additionally, the major purpose of the adoption of modular instruments in the aerospace and defense industry is due to its features such as lower power consumption and quick measurement of the end-use equipment.Increasing adoption of the Internet of Things concept by several industries will be a tailwind to the growth of the market during the forecast period.The growth of the market of modular instruments will be further fuelled by the increasing adoption of the internet of things (IoT) concept by various industries. Furthermore, the increased adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) by the government, healthcare, automotive, and utility sectors is expected to fuel market growth in the next few years. For instance, in the automotive sector, giants, like General Motors, plan to release autonomous (driverless car) cars in 2021. Similarly, AUDI collaborated with Nvidia to develop an efficient non-human supervised car model. The prototype of this highly automated car is based on AUDI's Q7 car model. Similarly, according to GSMA, there would be 30 billion connected devices by 2026. The IoT-connected devices include tracking devices, vehicles, utility meters, consumer electronics, and wearable technology vending machines, as well as smartphones and tablets. Thus, increased adoption of the aforementioned devices has led to the growing need for testing, inspecting, and verifying the smart products and other equipment to ensure the fidelity of the deployed devices. Moreover, an increasing number of connected devices results in more spending on testing the feasibility of the devices, thus resulting in the adoption of modular instruments. However, growing leasing and rental services are a few factors that may hinder the growth of the modular instruments market.

Sie können die recht ermutigenden ZahlenMore news about: ZTE Corporation","ZTE Corporation","Eine Keynote auf dem Mobile World Congress 2021SHENZHEN, China, 1. Juli 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Die ZTE Corporation (0763.HK / 000063.SZ), ein bedeutender internationaler Anbieter von Telekommunikations-, Unternehmens- und Verbrauchertechnologielösungen für das mobile Internet, gab heute bekannt, dass der CEO des Unternehmens, Xu Ziyang, bei der Eröffnungsfeier des Mobile World Congress 2021 eine Keynote mit dem Titel „Fuel the Digitalization, Endow with Intelligence"" gehalten hat.Laut Xu Ziyang sind die 5G-Anwendungen mit dem groß angelegten kommerziellen Einsatz von 5G-Netzen in eine Phase der iterativen Entwicklung eingetreten. Obwohl Herausforderungen wie ökologisches Bauen und Geschäftsmodelle zu bewältigen sind, wird die Richtung der Innovation allmählich klarer. ZTE hat, gestützt auf eine über zweijährige Praxis mit der Industrie und ökologischen Partnern, drei Hauptrichtungen der Anwendungsinnovation und eine Grundlage für die digitale Ermächtigung ausgearbeitet.Die drei oben genannten Innovationsrichtungen von 5G-Anwendungen umfassen insbesondere die Befähigung von Einzelpersonen mit 5G, die die Grenzen der Sinne erweitert und unendliche Möglichkeiten schafft, die Befähigung von Zielgruppen mit 5G, die die digitale Kluft überbrückt, und die Befähigung von Branchen mit 5G, die die industrielle Revolution fördert.In der Zwischenzeit hat die Stiftung für digitale Befähigung Durchbrüche in den Bereichen „allgegenwärtiges Breitband"", „allgegenwärtiges Computing"", „mehrdimensionale Konvergenz"" und „grünes Energiesparen"" erzielt, die starke Interaktionen in Echtzeit, agile und innovative Anwendungen, maximale Ressourceneffizienz und nachhaltige Entwicklung ermöglichen.Das Unternehmen ist bereit, diese zugrundeliegenden Fähigkeiten für alle Industrie- und Ökosystempartner zu öffnen, um eine Win-Win-Zukunft anzustreben.Hier folgt die Originalrede von Herrn Xu Ziyang: „Guten Morgen, guten Nachmittag und guten Abend, verehrte Gäste, meine Damen und Herren,Es ist mir eine große Ehre, am MWC Barcelona 2021 virtuell teilzunehmen, was sich sehr von dem unterscheidet, was wir früher gemacht haben. Was ich mit Ihnen teilen werde, ist ‚Fuel the Digitalization, Endow with Intelligence', das die Hoffnung in sich trägt, gemeinsam mit unseren Partnern im Ökosystem den Weg für die digitale und intelligente Transformation der menschlichen Gesellschaft zu finden, indem wir die digitale Grundlage kontinuierlich stärken.Wie viele von Ihnen wissen, sind seit der ersten Einführung von 5G bereits zwei Jahre vergangen. Bis heute sind über 1,1 Millionen 5G-Basisstationen rund um den Globus in Betrieb. 5G bringt nicht nur ein verbessertes Nutzererlebnis, sondern treibt die digitale und intelligente Transformation von Branchen voran. Was wir hier sehen, ist die 5G Intelligent Manufacturing Base von ZTE in Nanjing. Jede Minute werden hier fünf 5G-Basisstationen produziert, die in die ganze Welt verschickt werden. Es ist auch ein hervorragendes Beispiel für unsere Praxis im Bereich ‚Intelligent Manufacturing Powered by 5G'. Hier haben wir mit der vollständigen Abdeckung von 5G-Netzen und der Implementierung von MEC 10 typische 5G-Anwendungen bereitgestellt, die für die Realisierung einer intelligenten Fertigung unerlässlich sind, darunter Cloud-basierte FTS, 8K Machine Vision, Cloud-basierte SPS, Smart Storage, industrielle Wearables, digitale Zwillinge und Inspektion vor Ort. Sie können die recht ermutigenden Zahlen sehen, die Arbeitskraft wurde um 40 % reduziert, die Fehlerrate ging um 20 % zurück, und der Produktionszyklus wurde um 30 % gesenkt, während die Produktionseffizienz um 40 % erhöht wurde.Darüber hinaus haben wir zusammen mit über 90 Netzbetreibern und 500 Partnern weltweit innovative 5G-Anwendungen in einem breiten Spektrum erforscht, und es wurden massive Anwendungsfälle in mehr als 15 Branchen mit positiven Ergebnissen entwickelt. Wir freuen uns, dass die Veränderungen, die 5G und viele andere neue Informationstechnologien mit sich bringen, in Thailands Fabriken, Belgiens Häfen, Österreichs Bauernhöfen und in der Fertigung, dem Transportwesen, dem Stromnetz und dem Umweltschutz in China stattfinden.Obwohl sich 5G-Anwendungen noch in einem frühen Stadium befinden, können wir jetzt schon einige Richtungen klar erkennen. Die erste, die mir in den Sinn kam, ist, die Grenzen der Sinne zu erweitern und unendliche Möglichkeiten für den Einzelnen zu schaffen. Sie wissen, dass die Grenze zwischen der digitalen Welt und der physischen Welt dank der Einführung neuer Netzwerke und Cloud-Dienste allmählich verschwimmt. Smart Home macht unser Leben einfacher. Durch das Tragen eines AR/VR-Headsets können wir Reisen, Spiele, Sportereignisse und Konzerte bequem von zu Hause aus miterleben. Durch den Einsatz von Drohnen sind wir in der Lage, unsere Sicht zu erweitern. Mit Anwendungen wie dem autonomen Fahren, dem maschinellen Sehen, dem unbemannten Bergbau und den Rettungsrobotern werden unser Eigentum und unser Leben noch besser geschützt.Zweitens geht es darum, die digitale Kluft zu überbrücken, um die nachhaltigen Entwicklungsziele auf dem Globus zu erreichen. Zum Beispiel ermöglicht Telemedizin über 5G Ärzten und Spezialisten, Patienten aus der Ferne zu diagnostizieren, wodurch hochwertige medizinische Ressourcen in unmittelbarer Reichweite sind. Reporter können mit Hilfe der holografischen Technologie von Angesicht zu Angesicht mit Kunden kommunizieren. Das Fernstudium bietet gleiche Bildungschancen für Regionen in unterschiedlichen Entwicklungsstadien. 5G FWA ermöglicht die schnelle Bereitstellung von Breitbanddiensten in einigen Gebieten mit begrenzter Infrastruktur. Man kann von zu Hause aus genauso effektiv arbeiten wie im Büro. Mit der 5G-Air-To-Ground-Technologie können Passagiere während des Fluges Services genauso reibungslos genießen, wie wenn sie am Boden sind. Wie wir sehen können, verringert 5G die Distanz zwischen den Menschen und bringt die Herzen näher, was zu einer harmonischeren Gesellschaft führt.Darüber hinaus entwickeln wir im Einklang mit der modernen industriellen Revolution die Informationstechnologie, um die gesellschaftliche Entwicklung zu beschleunigen. So stellen intelligente Fabriken einen Sprung von der traditionellen Fertigung dar, der die Kosten senkt und gleichzeitig die Effizienz und Qualität verbessert. Intelligente Verkehrsinfrastruktur ermöglicht einen kohlenstoffarmen und effektiveren Transport. 5G hilft beim Aufbau zuverlässiger, sicherer, wirtschaftlicher, effizienter und umweltfreundlicher intelligenter Netze durch die Implementierung umfangreicher Konnektivität mit geringer Latenz und niedrigen Kosten, was letztendlich zur Reduzierung der Kohlenstoffemissionen führen soll. Mit 5G wird das intelligente Management in der Landwirtschaft Realität. 5G verbessert auch unser Lebensumfeld mit höherer Wasser- und Luftqualität und fördert so eine nachhaltige Entwicklung.Die innovativen Anwendungen, die wir heute haben, müssen sicherlich durch das Eintauchen in Größenvorteile und Geschäftsmodelle weiterentwickelt werden. Eine gemeinsame Anforderung sollte und muss jedoch identifiziert werden, nämlich die digitale Enablement-Plattform.Wie viele von Ihnen bereits wissen, ist ‚datengetrieben' zweifellos der Schlüssel zur digitalen Transformation von Hunderttausenden von Vertikalen. Folglich entwickelte sich aus der Rechenzentrik die Datenzentrik. Mit diesem Verständnis soll die Digital Foundation, die eine wichtige Rolle spielt, im Sinne von ‚Ubiquitous Broadband', ‚Pervasive Computing' und ‚Multidimensional Convergence' kontinuierlich verbessert werden. Obendrein werden neue Märkte erschlossen und die Nachhaltigkeit des Geschäfts gesichert.Wir sind der Meinung, dass sich die erweiterte Netzwerkfähigkeit in drei Aspekten nach oben bewegt: Bandbreite, Agilität und Scheduling.In Bezug auf die Erweiterung der Bandbreite sind vor allem die 5G-Uplink-Erweiterung und der optische Gigabit-Zugang für kabelgebundenes Breitband zu nennen.Was die Agilität des Netzwerks betrifft, so macht SRv6 IP-Netzwerke flexibler und programmierbar. FlexE-basierte VPN-Fähigkeit und Hard Slicing erfüllen die Anforderungen nach niedriger Latenz, geringem Jittering, höchster Zuverlässigkeit und sicherer Isolierung. Optische Netzwerke haben mit Mesh die nächste Evolutionsstufe erreicht, die die Kapazität verbessert, die Latenzzeit senkt und die Redundanz erhöht. Der Cloud-native Kern unterstützt die Bereitstellung und den Betrieb auf eine flexiblere, agilere und elastischere Weise.Wir können Ressourcenplanung, Trennung von Steuerung und Weiterleitung, automatisierte End-to-End-Slicing-Orchestrierung, automatisierte Bereitstellung innerhalb von Minuten und flexible Slicing-Operationen nutzen, um die Effizienz des Betriebs zu verbessern.Das Datenvolumen und die Datenvielfalt steigen in der AIoT-Ära rasant an. Inzwischen wird die Datenverarbeitung mit der Einführung von KI, z. B. Deep-Learning-Algorithmen, immer komplizierter. Die zentralisierten Rechnerkapazitäten sind in puncto Sicherheit und Effizienz nicht mehr zu übertreffen. Im Gegenteil, die Synergie zwischen Cloud und Terminal wurde als das Allheilmittel für diese Kopfschmerzen angesehen. Mit dem erkannten Kapazitätsunterschied zwischen Cloud, Edge und Terminal und der fortschrittlichen Optimierung von Software, Hardware und Chipsätzen wird die lastsensitive Hyperkonvergenz zum Schlüssel für eine Infrastruktur, die Skalierbarkeit, Agilität und schnelle Iteration garantiert.Das bringt mich eigentlich zu ein paar großen Worten: Cloud-Netz-Konvergenz, Software-Hardware-Konvergenz, KI-Konvergenz und auch intrinsische Sicherheit.Zunächst einmal brauchen wir Clouds on Demand und Cloud-Netz-Synergien, um die Diversitäten auszugleichen. Die Praxis, die wir im letzten Jahr implementiert haben, sagen wir ‚Precise Cloud and Network Solution', hat wirklich die Kraft eines guten Beispiels gezeigt, um vertikale Unternehmen zu bedienen und die digitale Transformation zu beschleunigen.Darüber hinaus bereichert die Software-Hardware-Konvergenz unsere Fähigkeiten, die Natur des Geschäfts und die Kosteneffizienz zu verfolgen. Software setzt auf Cloud-Native, Microservices und Komponenten; parallel dazu sucht die Hardware nach ultimativer Performance. Wir können deren harte Grenzen durchbrechen, indem wir eine gemeinsame und globale Optimierung durchführen, die für bestimmte Szenarien bestimmt ist. Wir werden zum Beispiel mehr universelle Beschleunigeroptionen und mehr Chiplet-Innovationen sehen.Apropos KI: Es geht darum, den Wert der Daten optimal zu nutzen. Die auf Big Data und Trainingsmodellen basierende KI-Konvergenz unterstützt die domänenübergreifende Koordination von Systemen und Knoten, erleichtert die Orchestrierung vom Rechenzentrum bis hinunter zur Funkschnittstelle und ermöglicht einen effizienteren Betrieb und Wartung.Nicht zuletzt fungiert die intrinsische Sicherheit als selbsterkennendes, selbstadaptives und selbstentwickelndes Immunsystem für Netzwerke. Es wurde während des Netzwerkaufbaus entwickelt, bietet mehrere Sicherheitsfunktionen und kann sich während des Netzwerkbetriebs automatisch weiterentwickeln, so dass die Sicherheit, die Dienste und die Daten ständig gewährleistet sind.Laut GSMA ist die Mobilfunkindustrie derzeit für etwa 0,4 % der weltweiten Kohlenstoffemissionen verantwortlich. Es ist das gemeinsame Ziel der Branche, den Kohlenstoffausstoß zu reduzieren. Um grüne Netzwerke mit geringerem Stromverbrauch aufzubauen, befürwortet ZTE geeignete Maßnahmen im gesamten Lebenszyklus des Netzwerks.Insbesondere kann eine effizientere und intelligentere Produktion und Fertigung mit geringerem Stromverbrauch durch 5G Industrial Internet, MEC und AI realisiert werden. Was Innovationen bei Basisstationen angeht, können wir das Design von Chipsätzen, Leistungsverstärkern und die Systemintegration für eine höhere Leistungseffizienz verbessern. Während des Netzaufbaus können die Kohlenstoffemissionen durch den Einsatz von sauberer Energie und hocheffizienter Notstromversorgung für Basisstationen und Wärmeableitungstechnologien für Rechenzentren, wie z. B. voreingestellte modulare Bauweise und Flüssigkeitskühltechnik, reduziert werden. Im Netzbetrieb können Lösungen wie PowerPilot für eine intelligente, auf Algorithmen basierende Verkehrsplanung eingesetzt werden, um den Stromverbrauch zu senken und gleichzeitig ein gutes Benutzererlebnis zu gewährleisten.Mit solchen Maßnahmen im gesamten Netzlebenszyklus können wir Betreibern dabei helfen, grüne Netze effektiver aufzubauen.Obwohl 5G bereits seit über zwei Jahren kommerziell genutzt wird, befindet es sich noch im Anfangsstadium. Um den kommerziellen Erfolg zu sichern, sollten wir auch bei der Entwicklung von Ökosystemen und Geschäftsmodellen gemeinsam an Innovationen arbeiten. ZTE hat sich der Entwicklung der Branche und des Ökosystems verschrieben und verfügt über umfangreiche Erfahrungen mit Kerntechnologien, E2E-DICT-Produkten und -Lösungen, Cloud-Komponenten und 5G-Innovationen. Wir sind bereit, diese zugrundeliegenden Fähigkeiten für alle Industrie- und Ökosystempartner zu öffnen. Ich bin gespannt, wohin uns dieser Trend führen wird. Lassen Sie uns gemeinsam an einer Zukunft arbeiten, von der alle profitieren.Vielen Dank!""Über ZTEZTE ist ein Anbieter von modernen Telekommunikationssystemen, mobilen Endgeräten und Netzwerklösungen für Mobilfunkbetreiber, Unternehmen, öffentliche Einrichtungen und private Anwender.

Hoewel uitdagingen zoals ecologisch bouwen en businessmodellen het hoofd moeten worden geboden, wordt de richting van innovatie langzamerhand duidelijker. ZTE heeft, ondersteund door meer dan twee jaar praktijkervaring met de industrie en ecologische partners, drie belangrijke richtingen voor applicatie-innovatie en een basis voor digitale empowerment uitgewerkt.De drie innovatierichtingen van 5G-toepassingen, zoals hierboven vermeld, hebben met name betrekking op het versterken van individuen met 5G die de grenzen van de zintuigen verlegt en het creëren van oneindige mogelijkheden, het versterken van doelgroepen met 5G om de digitale kloof te overbruggen, en het versterken van industrieën met 5G die de industriële revolutie bevordert.Ondertussen heeft de stichting voor digitale empowerment doorbraken bereikt op het gebied van ""alomtegenwoordige breedband"", ""pervasief computergebruik"", ""multidimensionale convergentie"" en ""besparing van groene energie"", waardoor sterke interacties in real-time, flexibele en innovatieve toepassingen, maximale hulpbronnenefficiëntie en duurzame ontwikkeling mogelijk zijn.Het bedrijf is bereid deze onderliggende capaciteiten open te stellen voor alle industrie- en ecosysteempartners om een win-win-toekomst te omarmen.Hier volgt de originele toespraak van de heer Xu Ziyang: ""Goedemorgen, goedemiddag en goedenavond, geachte gasten, dames en heren.Het is mij een grote eer om virtueel deel te nemen aan MWC Barcelona 2021, wat heel anders is dan we gewend zijn. Wat ik met jullie ga delen is ""Fuel the Digitalization, Endow with Intelligence"", dat de hoop draagt om samen met onze partners in het ecosysteem de weg te vinden voor de digitale en intelligente transformatie van de menselijke samenleving door de voortdurende versterking van de digitale basis.Zoals velen van jullie weten, is het twee jaar geleden sinds de eerste lancering van 5G. Tot op heden zijn er wereldwijd meer dan 1,1 miljoen 5G-basisstations in gebruik. 5G zorgt niet alleen voor een verbeterde gebruikerservaring, maar stimuleert ook de digitale en intelligente transformatie van verticale markten. Wat we zien is de 5G Intelligent Manufacturing Base van ZTE in Nanjing. Hier worden elke minuut vijf 5G-basisstations geproduceerd die over de hele wereld worden verscheept. Het is ook een uitstekend voorbeeld van onze werkwijze in 'Intelligent Manufacturing Powered by 5G'. Hier hebben we, met de volledige dekking van 5G-netwerken en implementatie van MEC, 10 typische 5G-toepassingen geïmplementeerd die essentieel zijn voor de realisatie van intelligente productie, waaronder de op de cloud gebaseerde AGV, 8K-machinevisie, de op de cloud gebaseerde PLC, slimme opslag, industriële wearables, digitale tweelingen en inspectie ter plaatse. U kunt de vrij bemoedigende cijfers zien, de mankracht werd met 40% verminderd, het aantal defecten daalde met 20% en de productiecyclus werd met 30% verminderd, terwijl de productie-efficiëntie met 40% werd verhoogd.Bovendien hebben we, samen met meer dan 90 operators en 500 partners wereldwijd, innovatieve 5G-toepassingen op een breed toepassingsgebied onderzocht op basis waarvan in meer dan 15 industriële sectoren met positieve resultaten massale gebruiksvoorbeelden zijn ontwikkeld. We zijn verheugd te zien dat de veranderingen die door 5G en vele andere nieuwe informatietechnologieën worden gebracht, plaatsvinden in de fabrieken van Thailand, de Belgische havens, de Oostenrijkse boerderijen en de productie, het transport, het elektriciteitsnet en de milieubescherming in China.Hoewel 5G-toepassingen zich nog in een vroeg stadium bevinden, kunnen we toch al duidelijk een aantal richtingen identificeren. Het eerste dat in me opkwam, is om de grenzen van de zintuigen te verleggen en mensen oneindig veel mogelijkheden te bieden. De grens tussen de digitale wereld en de fysieke wereld vervaagt langzamerhand dankzij de introductie van nieuwe netwerken en clouddiensten. Smart home maakt ons leven gemakkelijker. Met een AR/VR-headset kunnen we genieten van een bijna werkelijke ervaring van reizen, gamen, sportevenementen en concerten vanuit het comfort van ons eigen huis. Met de inzet van drones kunnen we onze visie verleggen. Met toepassingen zoals zelfrijdende voertuigen, machine vision, onbemande mijnbouw en reddingsrobots worden onze eigendommen en levens nog beter beschermd.Voorts is het om de digitale kloof te overbruggen en te streven naar duurzame ontwikkelingsdoelen in de wereld. Met Telemedicine over 5G kunnen artsen en specialisten bijvoorbeeld patiënten op afstand diagnosticeren, waardoor hoogwaardige medische middelen binnen handbereik zijn. Verslaggevers kunnen persoonlijk met klanten communiceren met behulp van de holografische technologie. Onderwijs op afstand biedt gelijke onderwijskansen voor gebieden in verschillende ontwikkelingsstadia. 5G FWA maakt snelle levering van breedbanddiensten mogelijk in sommige gebieden waar de infrastructuur beperkt is. Mensen kunnen nu net zo effectief thuis werken als op kantoor. Met de 5G Air-To-Ground-technologie kunnen passagiers tijdens de vlucht net zo moeiteloos gebruikmaken van diensten als op de grond. Zoals we kunnen zien, verkleint 5G de afstand tussen de mensen en brengt het harten dichter bij elkaar, wat leidt tot een meer harmonieuze samenleving.Bovendien ontwikkelen we, in lijn met de moderne industriële revolutie, informatietechnologie om de sociale ontwikkeling te versnellen. Slimme fabrieken vertegenwoordigen bijvoorbeeld een sprong voorwaarts tegen lagere kosten en betere efficiëntie en kwaliteit ten opzichte van traditionele fabrieken. Intelligente verkeersinfrastructuur maakt een lage CO2-uitstoot en effectiever transport mogelijk. 5G helpt bij het bouwen van betrouwbare netwerken die veilig, economisch, efficiënt en milieuvriendelijk zijn door uitgebreide connectiviteit met lage latentie en lage kosten te implementeren, wat uiteindelijk moet leiden tot minder CO2-uitstoot. Met 5G wordt intelligent beheer een realiteit in de landbouw. 5G verbetert ook onze leefomgeving met een betere water- en luchtkwaliteit en bevordert zo duurzame ontwikkeling.De innovatieve toepassingen die we vandaag hebben, moeten zeker verder worden ontwikkeld in schaalbare voordelen en bedrijfsmodellen. Eén gemeenschappelijke vereiste zou en moet echter worden vastgesteld, namelijk het platform voor digitale ondersteuning.Zoals velen van u al weten, is 'datagedreven' ongetwijfeld de sleutel tot digitale transformatie van honderdduizenden verticale markten. Het gevolg daarvan is de evolutie van computergericht naar gegevensgericht. Met dit inzicht zal de Digital Foundation, die een belangrijke rol speelt, voortdurend worden verbeterd in termen van 'alomtegenwoordige breedband', 'pervasief computergebruik' en 'multidimensionale convergentie'. Bovendien zullen nieuwe markten worden uitgebreid en de duurzaamheid van de bedrijfsvoering worden gewaarborgd.Wij zijn van mening dat de verbeterde netwerkcapaciteit in drie opzichten omhoog gaat: bandbreedte, flexibiliteit en planning.Wat betreft het verbreden van de bandbreedte, is de 5G-uplinkverbetering en gigabit optische toegang voor bekabelde breedband het vermelden waard.Wat netwerkflexibiliteit betreft, maakt de SRv6 IP-netwerken flexibeler en programmeerbaarder. Op FlexE gebaseerde VPN-mogelijkheden en hard slicing voldoen aan de eisen voor lage latentie, lage jittering, uiterste betrouwbaarheid en veilige isolatie. Optische netwerken namen mesh de volgende fase van evolutie in, die de capaciteit verbetert, de latentie verlaagt en de redundantie verhoogt. Cloud-native core ondersteunt implementaties en bedrijfsactiviteiten op een meer flexibele, wendbare en elastische manier.We kunnen resourceplanning, scheiding van beheer/doorsturen, geautomatiseerde instrumentarium voor end-to-end slicing, geautomatiseerde resultaten binnen enkele minuten en flexibele slicing-bewerkingen gebruiken om de efficiëntie van de bedrijfsvoering te verbeteren.Data neemt in het tijdperk van de kunstmatige intelligentie der dingen (AIoT-tijdperk) enorm toe in zowel volume als variëteit. Ondertussen wordt gegevensverwerking ingewikkelder met de introductie van AI, bijvoorbeeld deep learning-algoritmen. De gecentraliseerde rekencapaciteiten blinken niet meer uit op het gebied van veiligheid en efficiëntie. Integendeel, cloud-edge-terminal-synergie werd beschouwd als de oplossing hiervoor. Met het capaciteitsverschil tussen cloud, edge en terminal, en geavanceerde optimalisatie van software, hardware en chipsets, wordt belastinggevoelige hyperconvergentie de sleutel tot de infrastructuur die schaalbaarheid, wendbaarheid en snelle iteratie garandeert.Dit brengt me eigenlijk bij een paar grote woorden: cloud-netwerkconvergentie, software-hardwareconvergentie, AI-convergentie en ook intrinsieke beveiliging.Allereerst hebben we clouds on demand en cloud-netwerksynergie nodig om aan de diversiteiten te voldoen. De praktijk die we vorig jaar hebben geïmplementeerd, zeg maar 'Precise Cloud and Network Solution', toonde echt de kracht van een goed voorbeeld voor het bedienen van verticale ondernemingen en het versnellen van de digitale transformatie.Bovendien verrijkt software-hardwareconvergentie onze vaardigheden om de aard van de bedrijfsvoering en kostenefficiëntie na te streven. Software gaat voor cloud-native, microservices en componenten; parallel daaraan zoekt hardware naar ultieme prestaties. We kunnen de harde grenzen ervan doorbreken door voor specifieke scenario's gezamenlijke en algehele optimalisaties uit te voeren. We zullen bijvoorbeeld meer universele accelerator-opties en meer chiplet-innovaties zien.Het gaat bij AI overigens over het meeste uit datawaarde te halen. Op big data en trainingsmodellen gebaseerde AI-convergentie ondersteunt domeinoverschrijdende coördinatie van systemen en knooppunten, vergemakkelijkt het instrumentatrium van datacenter tot radio-interface en maakt efficiëntere werking en onderhoud mogelijk.Tot slot, maar niet minder belangrijk, fungeert intrinsieke beveiliging als een zelf-voelend, zelf-aanpassend en zichzelf ontwikkelend immuunsysteem voor netwerken. Gebouwd tijdens de netwerkconstructie, biedt intrinsieke beveiliging meerdere beveiligingsfuncties en kan het automatisch evolueren tijdens de werking van het netwerk, waardoor de veiligheid, de services en de gegevens constant worden gegarandeerd.Volgens GSMA is de mobiele communicatie-industrie momenteel verantwoordelijk voor ongeveer 0,4% van de wereldwijde CO2-uitstoot. Het is het gemeenschappelijke doel van de industrie om de CO2-uitstoot te verminderen. Om groene netwerken te bouwen met een lager stroomverbruik, pleit ZTE ervoor om de juiste maatregelen te nemen in de hele levenscyclus van het netwerk.Vooral efficiëntere en intelligentere productie en fabricage kan worden gerealiseerd met een lager stroomverbruik via 5G Industrial Internet, MEC en AI. Wat innovaties in basisstations betreft, kunnen we het ontwerp van chipsets, eindversterkers en systeemintegratie verbeteren voor een hogere energie-efficiëntie. Tijdens de netwerkconstructie kan de CO2-uitstoot worden verminderd door gebruik te maken van schone energie en zeer efficiënte back-upvoeding voor basisstations en warmteafvoertechnologieën voor datacenters, zoals vooraf ingesteld modulair ontwerp en technologie voor vloeistofkoeling. Bij netwerkgebruik kunnen oplossingen zoals PowerPilot worden gebruikt voor intelligente, op algoritmen gebaseerde verkeersplanning, waardoor het stroomverbruik wordt verlaagd en gebruikers gegarandeerd goede ervaringen hebben.Met dergelijke maatregelen in de hele levenscyclus van het netwerk kunnen we netwerkleveranciers helpen bij het effectiever bouwen van groene netwerken.Hoewel 5G al ruim twee jaar commercieel wordt ingezet, bevindt het zich nog in een vroeg stadium. Om het commerciële succes ervan veilig te stellen, moeten we ook samenwerken om te innoveren op het gebied van ecosysteemontwikkeling en bedrijfsmodellen. Toegewijd aan de ontwikkeling van de industrie en het ecosysteem, heeft ZTE een rijke ervaring opgedaan in kerntechnologieën, E2E DICT-producten en -oplossingen, cloud-componenten en 5G-innovaties. We zijn bereid om deze onderliggende mogelijkheden open te stellen voor alle industrie- en ecosysteempartners. Ik ben benieuwd waar deze trend ons zal brengen. Laten we samenwerken om een win-win toekomst te omarmen.Dank u.""Perswoordvoerder:Margaret Ma ZTE Corporation Tel: +86 755 26775189 E-mail: [email protected] Related Links www.zte.com.cn SOURCE ZTE Corporation"

The rise of automation in manufacturing continues to drive the adoption and evolution of machine vision technologies. Over the last decade and a half, these technologies have matured into a critical tool for advanced manufacturing automation, with primary applications being automated inspection and industrial robot guidance.A key characteristic of the factory of the future, or smart factory, is automation via the interoperability of machines, devices, sensors, and people-also known as Industry 4.0. As such, advancements in machine vision will be integral to future manufacturing success. The technology of robotic vision poses some of the key features which have led to increased adoption of the technology. The technology now enables robots to freely move and perform a variety of tasks without operator intervention and reprogramming. With advanced object detection, recognition, and grasping technology, these newly empowered robots are well-suited to manufacturing the customized products that are in high demand.By using advanced vision systems to adjust coordinates to specific locations, today's robots can pick up parts and items of varying consistency-a task that is impossible for traditional assembly robots. Now, robots with vision capabilities can recognize a changing environment and adapt to it.Manufacturing companies across the world are realizing the benefits of these robotic vision systems, particularly in areas where redundant tasks, like inspection, should be performed with precision. They are playing an essential role in high-speed production lines and hazardous environments. Some of the significant benefits offered by these systems include increased productivity, reduced machine downtime, and tighter process control.The advent of COVID-19 hurt the global robotic vision market. The market witnessed a slow growth rate during the year as several projects in the sector came to a withstand. The ongoing investments being done at that time were slowed down as the demand for this technology in various sectors fell during the initial months as the pandemic resulted in a substantial shift of focus to curb the spread of the disease.The demand for the technology witnessed a slight increase during the second half of the year as it came in handy while maintaining the social distancing protocols imposed by the government such as for the bar code scanner application. The demand for the technology is expected to witness a significant rise in the coming years as the pandemic has fuelled the use of bar code readers, scanners, autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and others.The growth of the robotic vision market is highly dependent on technological advancements and declining prices of chips and sensors. Some countries have stringent rules in place for worker's safety for which robotic vision is the optimal solution. The share of the automotive Industry as an end-user of the robotic vision market is expected to be significant because it requires automation in most of its processes, such as inspection, assembling, welding, among others.Recent developments with regards to self-driving cars would be leveraging the potential of robotic vision. The food and drink industry, an end-user of Robotic Vision, has already capitalized on robotic vision to avoid human involvement which is susceptible to commit errors and hence, achieve operational and cost-efficiency.Key Topics Covered: 1.

You can see the quite encouraging figures, the manpowerMore news about: ZTE Corporation","ZTE Corporation","SHENZHEN, China, June 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- ZTE Corporation (0763.HK / 000063.SZ), a major international provider of telecommunications, enterprise and consumer technology solutions for the mobile internet, today announced that the company's CEO Xu Ziyang has delivered a keynote speech entitled ""Fuel the Digitalization, Endow with Intelligence"" at the opening ceremony of Mobile World Congress 2021.According to Mr. Xu Ziyang, 5G applications, with the large-scale commercial deployments of 5G networks, have entered into a period of iterative development. Although challenges like ecological construction and business models need to be confronted with, the direction of innovation turns to be gradually clearer. ZTE, bolstered with over-two-year practices with the industry and ecological partners, has worked out three major application innovation directions and a digital empowerment foundation.The three innovation directions of 5G applications as mentioned above cover, specifically, empowering individuals with 5G expanding the boundaries of senses and creating infinite possibilities, empowering target groups with 5G bridging the digital gap, and empowering industries with 5G promoting the industrial revolution.Meanwhile, the digital empowerment foundation has achieved breakthroughs in ""ubiquitous broadband"", ""pervasive computing"", ""multi-dimensional convergence"" and ""green energy saving"", enabling strong interactions in real time, agile and innovative applications, maximum resource efficiency and sustainable development.The company is willing to open these underlying capabilities to all industry and ecosystem partners, to embrace a win-win future.Here comes the original speech of Mr. Xu Ziyang as follows: Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, It's my great honor to be participating in MWC Barcelona 2021 virtually, which is very different from the way we used to be. What I'm going to share with you is ""Fuel the Digitalization, Endow with Intelligence"", which bears the hope, together with our partners in the ecosystem, to find the way for the digital and intelligent transformation of human society by continuously strengthening the digital foundation. As many of you have known, it's been two years since the first launch of 5G. To date, over 1.1 million 5G base stations are in operation around the globe. 5G not only brings an improved user experience, but drives digital and intelligent transformation of verticals. What we are seeing is ZTE's 5G Intelligent Manufacturing Base in Nanjing. Five 5G base stations are produced here every minute, which are shipped all over the world. It is also an excellent example of our practice in ""Intelligent Manufacturing Powered by 5G"". Here, with the full coverage of 5G networks and implementation of MEC, we deployed 10 typical 5G applications which are essential to the realization of intelligent manufacturing, including cloud-based AGV, 8K machine vision, cloud-based PLC, smart storage, industrial wearables, digital twins, and onsite inspection. You can see the quite encouraging figures, the manpower was reduced by 40%, the defect rate went down by 20%, and the production cycle was declined by 30%, while the production efficiency was increased by 40%. Moreover, we, together with over 90 operators and 500 partners in globe, have been exploring innovative 5G applications on a wide scope, and massive use cases in more than 15 industry sectors were developed with positive outcomes. We are pleased to see that the changes brought by 5G and many other new information technologies are taking place in Thailand's factories, Belgium's ports, Austria's farms, and manufacturing, transportation, power grid, and environmental protection in China. Though 5G applications are still in the earlier stage, we can now clearly identify a few directions. The first one came into my mind is to expand the boundaries of senses and create infinite possibilities for individuals. You know, the boundary between the digital world and the physical world is gradually getting blurred, thanks to the introduction of new networks and cloud services. Smart home makes our life easier. Wearing an AR/VR headset, we can enjoy immersive experience of traveling, gaming, sports events, and concerts from the comfort of our own homes. By operating drones, we are able to extend our vision. With such applications as autonomous driving, machine vision, unmanned mining, and rescue robots, our property and lives are becoming even better protected. Secondly, it is to bridge the digital gap, aiming for sustainable development goals in globe. For example, Telemedicine over 5G allows doctors and specialists to diagnose patients remotely, putting high-quality medical resources within immediate reach. Reporters can communicate with customers face to face using the holographic technology. Distance learning provides equal educational opportunities for regions at different development stages. 5G FWA enables rapid provision of broadband services in some areas with limited infrastructure. People can freely work from home as effectively as in the office. With the 5G Air-To-Ground technology, passengers can enjoy in-flight services just as smooth as when they are on the ground. As we can see, 5G narrows the distance between the people and brings hearts closer, leading to a more harmonious society. Furthermore, in line with the modern industrial revolution, we develop information technology to accelerate social development. For instance, smart factories represent a leap from the traditional manufacturing, lowering costs while improving efficiency and quality. Intelligent traffic infrastructure facilitates low-carbon emission and more effective transportation. 5G helps construct reliable, safe, economical, efficient, and environment-friendly smart grids by implementing extensive connectivity with low latency and low cost, which eventually is to reduce carbon emissions. With 5G, intelligent management becomes a reality in agriculture. 5G also improves our living environment with higher water and air quality, thus promoting sustainable development. The innovative applications we have today certainly need to be further developed by diving in economies of scale and business models. However, one common requirement should and must be identified, which is the digital enablement platform. As many of you have already been aware, ""data driven"" is no doubt the key to digital transformation of hundreds of thousands of verticals. Consequently, computing-centric evolved into data-centric. With this understanding, the Digital Foundation, which plays the important role, shall be improved continuously in terms of ""ubiquitous broadband"", ""pervasive computing"", and ""multi-dimensional convergence"". On top of it, new markets will be expanded and business sustainability will be secured. We believe that the enhanced network capability moves its way up in three aspects: bandwidth, agility, and scheduling. In terms of widening the bandwidth, what is worth mentioning is the 5G uplink enhancement and gigabit optical access for wired broadband. As for network agility, the SRv6 makes IP networks more flexible and programmable. FlexE-based VPN capability and hard slicing satisfy the demands for low latency, low jittering, ultra-reliability, and secure isolation. Optical networks took mesh the next stage of evolution, which improves capacity, lowers latency, and increases redundancy. Cloud-native core supports deployments and operations in a more flexible, agile, and elastic manner. We can use resource scheduling, control/forwarding separation, automated end-to-end slicing orchestration, automated provisioning within minutes, and flexible slicing operations to improve the efficiency of operation. Data is soaring in both volume and variety in the AIoT era. Meanwhile, data processing becomes more complicated with the introduction of AI, for instance, deep learning algorithms. The centralized computing capacities no longer excel in terms of security and efficiency. On the contrary, cloud-edge-terminal synergy has been considered the cure-all for this headache. With the capacity difference recognized among cloud, edge and terminal, and advanced optimization on software, hardware, and chipsets, load-sensitive hyper-convergence becomes the key to the infrastructure which guarantees scalability, agility, and fast iteration. This actually brings me to a few big words: cloud-network convergence, software-hardware convergence, AI convergence, and also intrinsic security. First of all, we do need clouds on demand and cloud-network synergy to fit the diversities. The practice we implemented last year, say ""Precise Cloud and Network Solution"", really showcased the power of a good example for serving vertical enterprises and accelerating the digital transformation. In addition, software-hardware convergence enriches our skill sets to pursue the nature of business and cost efficiency. Software goes for cloud-native, micro services, and components; in parallel, hardware is looking for ultimate performance. We can break the hard boundaries of them by conducting joint and global optimization dedicated for specific scenarios. For instance, we will see more universal accelerator options, and more chiplet innovations. Speaking of AI, it is to make the most of data value. Big data and training model-based AI convergence supports cross-domain coordination of systems and nodes, facilitates orchestration from data center down to radio interface, and enables more efficient operation and maintenance. Last but not the least, intrinsic security acts as a self-sensing, self-adaptive, and self-evolving immune system for networks. Built during network construction, it offers multiple security functions, and can evolve automatically during network operation, thus constantly guaranteeing the security, services, and data. According to GSMA, the mobile communications industry is currently responsible for around 0.4% of carbon emissions globally. It is the common goal of the industry to reduce carbon emissions. To build green networks with lower power consumption, ZTE advocates taking proper measures in the whole network life cycle. Specially, more efficient and intelligent production and manufacturing can be realized with lower power consumption through 5G Industrial Internet, MEC, and AI. As for innovations in base stations, we can improve the design of chipsets, power amplifiers, and system integration for higher power efficiency. During network construction, carbon emissions can be reduced by using clean energy and highly efficient backup power supply for base stations, and heat dissipation technologies for data centers, such as preset modular design and liquid cooling technology. In network operation, solutions such as PowerPilot can be used for intelligent algorithm-based traffic scheduling, thus lowering power consumption while ensuring good user experience. With such measures in the whole network life cycle, we can assist operators in building green networks more effectively. Although 5G has been put into commercial use for over two years, it is still in the earlier stage. To secure its commercial success, we should also work together to innovate in ecosystem development and business models. Committed to the development of the industry and ecosystem, ZTE has gained rich experience in core technologies, E2E DICT products and solutions, cloud components, and 5G innovations. We are willing to open these underlying capabilities to all industry and ecosystem partners. I am excited to see where this trend will lead us. Let's work together to embrace a win-win future.

This largely stems from the ever-increasing adoption of machine vision, in which image analysis is performed by computational algorithms. Machine learning requires as much input data as possible to establish correlationsMore news about: IDTechEx","IDTechEx","BOSTON, June 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Image sensing is an essential capability, utilized across multiple applications that range from webcams and smartphone cameras to autonomous vehicles and industrial inspection. The brand new report from IDTechEx, ""Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets"", comprehensively explores the market for emerging image sensors, covering a diverse range of technologies that span from thin film flexible photodetectors to event-based vision.Motivation for Emerging Image Sensor TechnologiesContinue ReadingTechnologies included within the new IDTechEx report “Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets”While conventional CMOS detectors for visible light are well established and somewhat commoditized, at least for low-value applications, there is an extensive opportunity for more complex image sensing hardware that offer capabilities beyond simply acquiring red, green, and blue (RGB) intensity values at each pixel. This largely stems from the ever-increasing adoption of machine vision, in which image analysis is performed by computational algorithms. Machine learning requires as much input data as possible to establish correlations that can facilitate object identification and classification, so acquiring optical information over different wavelength ranges, or with spectral resolution, for example, is highly advantageous.Of course, emerging image sensor technologies offer many other benefits. This can include similar capabilities at a lower cost, increased dynamic range, improve temporal resolution, spatially variable sensitivity, global shutters at high resolution, reducing the unwanted influence of scattering, flexibility/conformality, and more. The brand new IDTechEx report, ""Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets"", covers many emerging technologies, specifically:Quantum dots on silicon hybrid image sensors Organic photodetectors on silicon hybrid image sensors Emerging SWIR image sensor technologies, including extended range silicon. Organic and perovskite photodiodes (OPDs and PPDs) Event-based vision Hyperspectral imaging Flexible x-ray image sensors Wavefront imagingEmerging Image Sensor TechnologiesEmerging image sensor technologies within the report include:Hybrid image sensors - Adding an additional light-absorbing layer on top of a CMOS read-out circuit is a hybrid approach that utilizes either organic semiconductors or quantum dots to increase the spectral sensitivity into the SWIR region. Currently dominated by expensive InGaAs sensors, this new technology promises a substantial price reduction and hence the adoption of SWIR imaging for new applications such as autonomous vehicles. Extended-range silicon - Given the very high price of InGaAs sensors, there is considerable motivation to develop much lower-cost alternatives that can detect light towards the lower end of the SWIR spectral region. Such SWIR sensors could then be employed in vehicles to provide better vision through fog and dust due to reduced scattering. Thin film photodetectors - Detection of light over a large area, rather than at a single small detector, is highly desirable for acquiring biometric data and, if flexible, for imaging through the skin. Emerging approaches that utilize solution processable semiconductors offer a compelling way to produce large-area conformal photodetectors for applications such as under-display fingerprint detection.Event-based vision - Autonomous vehicles, drones, and high-speed industrial applications require image sensing with a high temporal resolution. However, with conventional frame-based imaging, a high temporal resolution produces vast amounts of data that requires computationally intensive processing. Event-based vision is a new way of obtaining optical information that combines greater temporal resolution of rapidly changing image regions with much reduced data transfer and subsequent processing requirements.OverviewIn summary, the increasing adoption of machine vision provides a great opportunity for emerging image sensing technologies that offer capabilities beyond conventional CMOS sensors. This report offers a comprehensive overview of the market for emerging image sensor technologies, covering a multitude of applications that range from autonomous vehicles to industrial quality control. ""Emerging Image Sensor Technologies 2021-2031: Applications and Markets"", outlines the current status and future application for a wide range of emerging image sensors. Also included are highly granular 10-year market forecasts by revenue and volume (split by technology and application), along with multiple application case studies and technological/commercial readiness assessments.
